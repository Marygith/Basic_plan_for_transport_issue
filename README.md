# Overview:
***
#### This program is designed to solve a transport problem using five different DM algorithms:
***
+ the method of minimum cost
+ the method of northwest corner
+ the method of northeast corner
+ the method of southeast corner
+ the method of southwest corner
***
#### They will be compared by final transportation cost to find the most optimal one.
#### There will be some experimental transportation problems to define an algorithm that is the most beneficial statistically.
